# 🔍 BCG Data Science Job Simulation – PowerCo Churn Analysis

This project is part of the [Boston Consulting Group (BCG) Data Science Virtual Experience](https://www.theforage.com/simulations/bcg/data-science-ccdz) on [Forage](https://www.theforage.com/). In this simulation, I took on the role of a BCG data scientist working with a fictional client, PowerCo, to help understand and reduce customer churn.

---

## 🧠 Project Overview

PowerCo is a leading utility provider facing increasing customer churn in a competitive market. As a data scientist at BCG, my task was to analyze customer behavior, predict churn, and provide actionable insights to support strategic decision-making.

---

## 📈 Objectives

- Identify patterns and key drivers of customer churn.
- Build and evaluate a predictive model for churn classification.
- Translate technical findings into business recommendations.

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- **Language**: Python  
- **Libraries**: `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `scikit-learn`, `xgboost`
- **Modeling Techniques**: Random Forest, Hyperparameter Tuning, Classification Metrics

---

## 📊 Project Steps

### 1. Business Understanding
- Defined the problem and key metrics for churn analysis.
- Outlined a strategic data investigation approach.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Analyzed customer demographics, service usage, and churn history.
- Visualized trends and class imbalances using Seaborn and Matplotlib.

### 3. Data Preprocessing
- Handled missing values and encoded categorical features.
- Addressed class imbalance using `class_weight='balanced'`.

### 4. Feature Engineering
- Created relevant features to enhance model learning.
- Removed redundant or low-importance variables.

### 5. Model Development
- Trained a Random Forest classifier.
- Achieved **85% accuracy** on the test data.
- Evaluated using F1-score, recall, precision, and confusion matrix.

### 6. Executive Summary
- Delivered a concise business report with:
  - Key churn drivers
  - Strategic recommendations
  - Visual summaries of model performance and insights

---

## 🧾 Key Insights

- Tenure, pricing, and customer complaints were strong indicators of churn.
- Early intervention strategies can be developed based on churn probability.
- Data science enables personalized retention efforts in the utility sector.
